# ResBaz-Aotearoa-LaTeX

As part of ResBaz Aotearoa, the Centre for eResearch at the University of Auckland provides a short, hands-on introduction to LaTeX.

This introduction is structured into a set of steps that build upon each other to provide attendees with a headstart to learning LaTeX and are focussed on creating articles and reports.

The steps discussed are:
 1. The structure of a $\LaTeX$ document - frontmatter, the document class, adding packages and the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` commands.
 2. Adding structure to a document - `\section{}`, `\subsection{}` and `\subsubsection{}``
 3. Adding graphics - the `graphicx` package and the use of `\begin{figure}`, `\end{figure}`, `\includegraphics{}`and `\caption{}`
 4. Adding equations and cross-referencing - the `amsmath` package `\label{}`, `\ref{}`
