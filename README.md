# ResBaz-Aotearoa-LaTeX

As part of ResBaz Aotearoa, the Centre for eResearch at the University of Auckland provides a short, hands-on introduction to LaTeX.

This introduction is structured into a set of steps that build upon each other to provide attendees with a headstart to learning LaTeX and are focussed on creating articles and reports.

The steps discussed are:
 1. The structure of a $\LaTeX$ document - frontmatter, the document class, adding packages and the $\begin{document}$ and $\end{document}$ commands.
 2. Adding structure to a document - $\section{}$, $\subsection{}$ and $\subsubsection{}$
